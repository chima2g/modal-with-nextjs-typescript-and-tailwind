Note that line 40 of his ConfirmationModal goes off screen, so I had to improvise some changes there. 

Also, the child passed to the modal looked different on my screen, so I had to improvise some its css too.

The example from the article that this is based on currently errors and no longer works due to a problem with the react-transition-group package

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
